#Specifications - Learn Programming Mentoring Community Channel

##Overview
This is a functional specification, designed to give direction as to how the user will interact with the applet. 
It is not intended to be a piece of technical documentation, nor is it a complete list of needed features or ideas.
It is merely a starting point in order to have a framework with which to work from. Technical decisions such as how data
is moved around the program are left to the discretion of the programmer.
